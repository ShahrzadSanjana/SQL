/* 1) List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'. 
world(name, continent, area, population, gdp) */

SELECT name FROM world
WHERE population > (SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Russia');


/* 2) Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'. HINT: The per capita GDP is the gdp/population */

SELECT name
FROM world
WHERE continent = 'Europe' AND gdp/population > (SELECT gdp/population FROM world WHERE name = 'United Kingdom');
