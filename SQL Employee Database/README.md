**Background**

I am regularly looking for projects to improve and demonstrate my progress as a data analyst, and I found this one through someone elseâ€™s GitHub repository. I thought it would be a good idea if I attempted the following tasks to reinforce some old skills as well as learn a few important ones relating to Data Engineering! In a nutshell, I created six tables, then linked them together using foreign keys, impoted data from CSV files, and answered the questions that follow. I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for the entire project.


**Data Engineering**

1. Use the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
2. Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

I created tables using either SQL syntax (for tables containing only a few rows of data) or through the 'Import flat file' method in SQL Server (in order to create **and** import larger tables of data).   

Here are a few tables created using SQL syntax, followed by my syntax to establish foreign keys between tables.

```sql
USE employee_project;

CREATE TABLE "dept_manager" ("dept_no" NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, "emp_no" INT NOT NULL)
INSERT INTO "dept_manager" VALUES('d001', 110022),
('d001', 110039), ('d002', 110085), ('d002', 110114), ('d003', 110183), ('d003', 110228), ('d004', 110303), ('d004', 110344),
('d004', 110386), ('d004', 110420), ('d005', 110511), ('d005', 110567), ('d006', 110725), ('d006', 110765), ('d006', 110800),
('d006', 110854), ('d007', 111035), ('d007', 111133), ('d008', 111400), ('d008', 111534), ('d009', 111692), ('d009', 111784),
('d009', 111877), ('d009', 111939);

SELECT * FROM dept_manager; ```

**Data Analysis**

Once there is a complete database, answer the following questions:


1) List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
```sql 
SELECT employees.emp_no, last_name, first_name, sex, salary
FROM employees
JOIN salaries 
ON employees.emp_no=salaries.emp_no; 
```

2) List employees who were hired in 1986.

```sql
SELECT emp_no, first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM [dbo].[employees]
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31';
```

3) List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, and first name.
```sql 
SELECT dept_manager.dept_no, departments.dept_name, employees.emp_no, last_name, first_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_manager
ON employees.emp_no=dept_manager.emp_no
JOIN departments
ON departments.dept_no=dept_manager.dept_no;
```

4) List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_no, last_name, first_name, dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no=departments.dept_no;
```

5) List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_no, first_name, last_name 
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Hercules'  AND last_name LIKE 'B%';
```

6) List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_no, last_name, first_name, dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no=departments.dept_no
WHERE dept_name = 'Sales';
```

7) List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
```sql
SELECT employees.emp_no, last_name, first_name, dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no=dept_emp.emp_no
JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no=departments.dept_no
WHERE dept_name = 'Sales' OR dept_name ='Development';
```

8) In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
```sql
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) AS "Frequency" 
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY COUNT(last_name) DESC;
```
