***Background***

I am regularly looking for projects and assignments to improve and demonstrate skills and progress as a data analyst, and I found this one through someone elseâ€™s Github repository. I thought it would be a good idea if I attempted the questions to reinforce some old skills as well as learn a few important ones relating to Data Engineering!
I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for the entire project; from creating the database and tables, to importing data and writing queries and, as such, the following commentary applies to this program in particular. 

Designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and answered questions about the data.
